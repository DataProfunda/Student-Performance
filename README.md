What features determines grades of students? <br>
What the difference between female and male students? <br>
How alcohol consumption influence grades? <br>
Can we predict sex of the students? <br>

Two dataset concatenated together contain 1044 rows and 33 columns.

One of interesting correlation is Dalc(Daily alcohol consumption) and G3(Last grade)

The best students consume the least amount of alcohol. 

Another interesting correlations are grades, failures, higher and studytime

There is strong correlation between failures and grades. Students with more exams failure tend to have worse grades.
Students that want to go higher in education are more likely to study more and have less failure.

Mean G1 < G2 < G3. Students tend to have better last grades.

-to study more.
